# Character Builder

This application will generate a character and give the character a 
player class similar to Dungeons and Dragons.  This may grow into something more but 
for the time being, it is simply that.

## Inventory System To Update

Soon I will update the Inventory System to use smart pointers instead of raw pointers. 
This shouldn't take too long.

## Things to Tackle
- ~~Character Class Module~~
- ~~Race Module~~
- ~~Inventory Module~~
